Various code snippets to analyze ALICE cosmic data.

I should have saved them years ago, now their history and evolution is
completely a mess. I won't keep track of it now: let's say this repo is
a snapshot of the current (i.e. somehow the latest) version of the analysis
software, mainly to avoid losing it and have it at hand even when my
desktop is down (which is quite likely, due to the current conditions of
the Physics building electrical plant).

Some code is mine, other code was developed by B.Alessandro. Usually the
author name is written at the very beginning.

Some macros and scripts are fundamental for submitting analysis jobs on
AliEn, getting their output and checking the production. Other macros are
tests done during the development or to check some peculiar runs; they
were saved here for reference in case they contain some general purpose
code but without any cleanup.

- datalist : folder containing lists of runs to be analysed and of
analysis job ids
